## General Info  :space_invader:
***
E-commerce with simple functionality so that customers can add the most exclusive products to their shopping cart and add or remove items.
 <p>The objective is to make a replica of the design of the landing page proposed by the client with the priority that the user can interact with the drumkit, in such a way that when he clicks on each of the "pads" a different sound is emitted.</p>
